ULTIMA282.BAS asks the user to enter the folder/filename prefix of the
files to be used to store application output. ULTIMA282.BAS prompts the
user to define the rules of a card game belonging to the Blackjack family
of table-card games. ULTIMA282.BAS conducts a math analysis of the card game
by means of the abbreviated-combinatorial-analysis method. ULTIMA282.BAS
assembles the results of the math analysis into a set of tables. The set of
tables consists of a set of combination-dependent-playing-strategy tables,
and a combination-dependent-expected-value table. ULTIMA282.BAS calculates
an estimate of the expected value of the game and adds it to the bottom of
the combination-dependent-expected value table. ULTIMA282.BAS stores the
user-defined set of game rules and the set of tables in a set of files.
ULTIMA283.BAS can load the data contained in these files into program
memory and use the data to conduct a simulation of the card game wherein;
the computer-controlled player uses the set of strategy tables to make
decisions on how to play the player's hand. ULTIMA293.BAS can load the
data contained in these files into program memory and use the data to
assemble a total-dependent-basic-strategy table.
