BJ282.BAS asks users to defined the rules of a blackjack game.
BJ282.BAS conducts a math analysis of the game by means of the
complete-combinatorial-analysis method. BJ282.BAS assembles
the results of the math analysis into a set of tables.
The set of tables consists of a set of combination-dependent-
playing-strategy tables, and a combination-dependent-expected-
value table. BJ282 calculates an estimate of the expected value
of the game and adds it to the bottom of the combination-
dependent-playing-strategy table. BJ282.BAS stores the results
of the math analysis and the set of table in a set of files.
A subset of the set of files are text files. The text files
contain the set of tables assembled by BJ282.BAS.
A subset of the set of files that can be loaded into and used
by ULTIMA283.BAS to conduct a game simulation wherein; the
computer-controlled player uses the strategy tables to make
decisions on how to play the player's hand. A subset of the
set of files can be loaded into and used by ULTIMA293.BAS
to assemble a total-dependent-basic-strategy table.
